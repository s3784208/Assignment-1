										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My name is David Bozin my student number is s3784208, my email address is dbozin7@hotmail.com, I’m half Romanian half Czechoslovakian, I can speak and understand a little Romanian and I like playing soccer, going mountain bike riding and playing video games.
 My interest in IT is mainly in video games, VR and just computers in general. I’d like to know how games are made so that I could make my own and I would also like to know how computers work. My interest in IT started about 3-4 years ago when I became more and more interested in computers as I was going to purchase one and wanted to make the right decision. An interesting fact about me is that I’m a curious individual and like learning about pretty much  anything and everything which can make life difficult when you’re trying figure out what you want to do for a job. My IT experience is very limited, but I’d like to improve it and that’s why I am undertaking a bachelor of IT course. I Chose to come to RMIT as it was easy to get to and it being in the city allows me access to higher quality food. During my studies I expect to learn how to program, how databases work and more about IT related stuff.

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>the position is being a front-end developer ie working on things that are client side or that users see and deal with for a company who builds technologies for games. The company offers flexible working hours which is what find appealing along with the wage 100-150k and the fact that its located in the CBD/inner suburbs along with the Option to work in California from our San Francisco office from time to time which I find appealing cos I like travelling.
The skills ,experience and qualifications required for the job include: being able to effectively work in a team and communicate effectively with others, being able to learn new things quickly, having experience with JavaScript, building web applications, html, others and an understanding of what good programming is, good at using time efficiently,   having 9+ years of experience in various things.
The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have amount to be very patient and good at problem solving in general, along with very minimal computer skills.
I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience necessary by continuing with my current degree( a bachelor of IT) or possibly swapping to computer science and then after getting a degree attempting to get a job in the field with the skills that I have and simply working towards gaining experience in the fields necessary during and outside of work.

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p> My results from various tests state that i am a tactile learner, i am an INFP -A/-T personality type and i have a 78% openess to creativity. i think that these tests mean that as im a tactile learner i should simply preactice doing things over and over again and try and work things out myself. As INFP’s only focus their attention on a few people I think it would be best if I work in smaller groups rather than larger ones. This may influence my behavior
									in larger teams as I may not fully cooperate with all the members of the team and choose to work more closely with a select few which may hinder the capabilities of the whole. I am unsure whether I would act so in a team environment however the description of an INFP suggests as much. Also i think that i should try to express myself as i got a high openess to creativity score.

												<h4>Myers Briggs Test</h4>
												<p>The results of my Myers Briggs test is that i'm a Mediator personality type (INFP, -A/-T)."INFP personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, INFPs have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine." - 16 personalities website https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality   </p>

You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=5&T=8

												<h4>Creativity Test</h4>
												<p>Your responses indicate that you are generally not afraid to let your imagination run wild when problem-solving. You seem to realize that, while rules and conventions have their place in the process, they can be restrictive when coming up with innovative solutions. Therefore, although you won't immediately reject solutions that have worked in the past, you'd rather not have them be your only option. People who score similarly to you tend to be “out-of-the-box” thinkers who like to toy with different ideas, pushing beyond the boundaries of standard ways of thinking and doing things. They aren't opposed to taking risks or testing solutions that are “off-the-wall” or that don't have a proven track record. http://psychologytoday.tests.psychtests.com/bin/report?req=MTF8MzIwMXwyNDYwMDU1NHwxfDE=&refempt=1553412271.24600554.11</p>

									<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
									<p>As I am interested in games my project idea is to develop a game using a tool such as Unity. The game that I would like to make is an isometric ie top down view type game that is very similar to Shadowrun on the Sega Genesis in terms of art style (pixelated 1994, old school UI black background with green text for menu’s) and things you can do in it in general. The general theme of the game would be cyberpunk, like blade runner or altered carbon. I would like a feature to be co-op. I’d like the game to be an RPG and it’d be cool if it was like a RPG boardgame. If co op was implemented ideally it would be like divinity original sin 2’s in that characters should have separate stories and be able to cooperate or not.
My motivation for creating a game like this is that it is something that I would personally enjoy also just to entertain people in general. Furthermore, I’ve always wanted there to be more multiplayer RPG games out there or games that are similar to board games in that RPG fashion, essentially like D&D. I think the project would be interesting because if the game was made co-op (similar to divinity original sin 2) then there aren’t many games out there with co-op and isometric and somewhat story driven. Furthermore, as cyberpunk 2077 is coming out more and more people are probably going to be getting into cyberpunk esqe games.
The game will be targeted towards gamers who don’t mind investing a lot of time or energy into the game and like RPG games as such It will have a large amount of details for example classes, skills, mechanics and give the player/s a lot of opportunities to roleplay or make distinct characters that are their own. The game to be set in the future where technology has advanced in certain areas like weaponry but stayed the same in areas like computer technology. I would like the general theme to be cyberpunk esqe with hackers who can steal and sell data and fight corporations. However, the magic aspect of Shadowrun won’t be in the game I also like the idea of the main way to make money in the game stealing data from businesses and selling it or working with corporations to sabotage other corporations. I’d like the game to nonlinear with multiple ways of doing things and give the player a lot of choices and options for what they want to do. The combat system will be a dice roll text system like Pokémon but with RPG elements like different stats for characters that you could choose to improve after a character would get enough experience. I’d like there to be different gangs in the game as well like an anti-corporation group, a group that believes in augmenting their own body like cyborgs and an anti-cyborg group along with obviously being able to work with the corporations if one chooses to do so and I’d like there to be pros and cons with siding with any side like you may get attacked by the anti-corporation groups in the game if you choose to work with a big corporation or etc. Also, co-op could be a major new feature not necessarily online but a split screen /joint screen. The story would involve a corporation somehow wronging the main character who will try and find a way to screw over that company. I’d like the art style and UI to be like Shadowrun on genesis.The tools and technologies needed are any computer or laptop it doesn’t really matter as the minimum hardware requirements to make or run the game shouldn’t be that high as it will likely be a text-based RPG game. The software which will be used is unity which is free and can be found at:https://unity3d.com/unity?_ga=2.217626454.1917959203.1553984797-1901363291.1553984797 furthermore free assets may need to be used or purchased of unity along with a tool to create custom assets such as Aseprite( https://www.aseprite.org/ )or photoshop.
The skills required for the project would be an understanding of how to use unity and some sort of an editor like photoshop which can be used to create custom assets for the game when and if necessary. There is no special hardware required. It will be very feasible to acquire the skills, software and hardware required. The skills required can be obtained through YouTube videos and using the software repeatedly.  
If the project is successful then the outcome would be a complete game with minimal bugs and just an enjoyable solo/ multiplayer experience, maybe a new genre of games could become a thing and more games from different developers could be made as they were inspired from this game and maybe a bit of money could be made if it could be sold which could lead to another game being made.
